# EX.-NO-1-B-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-PLAYFAIR-CIPHER

## AIM:
  To write a C program to implement the Playfair Substitution technique.
  
## ALGORITHM:
  ## STEP-1:
    Read the plain text from the user.
  ## STEP-2:
    Read the keyword from the user.
  ## STEP-3:
    Arrange the keyword without duplicates in a 5*5 matrix in the row order and fill the remaining cells with missed out letters in alphabetical order. Note that ‘i’ and ‘j’ takes the same cell.
  ## STEP-4:
    Group the plain text in pairs and match the corresponding corner letters by forming a rectangular grid.
  ## STEP-5:
    Display the obtained cipher text.

## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the Playfair cipher substitution technique had been implemented successfully.
